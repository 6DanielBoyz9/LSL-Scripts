// A simple quiz to ask questions, get answers and give out a notecard
// :CODE:
A notecard is given when the quiz is played and won.

I gave you a choice for it to chat publicly so anyone can hear, or privately.   I set it to PRIVATE, IM chat. 
Here is why:    Pairs of people play.  They collaborate.  And then there is the single player.  
( There are always personalities that collaborate, and there are the quiet loners/lurkers).      Your system will be used to chat an answer (How many steps...").     
You do not want to speak this out loud,  so I set the default to IM, or Private mode.  
Then the pairs of people and onlookers either have to collaborate or figure it out for themselves.   This is good game design.

There is another situation where I would use PUBLIC.  The entrance .   People wil be standing there, wondering what to do.  
If someone walks into/touches the game start, they can see the chat, and will know what to do.  
This works great for those loners that will not collaborate and are stuck.  And the collaborators will see that their friend figured it out, 
and be happy for them!

You didn't say how the prompt is triggered at the very start, so I gave some choices for you.  You can do nothing, touch, or collision to get it to prompt you.   
Just set the variables COLLISION or TOUCH to FALSE or TRUE for the possible ways.    

You can set the TOUCH and COLLISION to FALSE and they have to figure out where to type, and what, somehow else. 

My experience is you need to tell them what to do.  Then tell them again.  So I gave you these setting to help in different places.   
Remember that with TOUCH = TRUE, they will still need to know to touch it!   

With COLLISION = TRUE, they can just bump into it,  and it will tell them what to do.   
So I usually start my games with collision, tell them what to do then, and they will know to click things. 

For COLLISION,  It works best as an invisible prim, and set COLLISION = TRUE. 
Make a prim 100% alpha and put it in the pathway so someone will collide with it.  Whenever they walk thru it, it chats to them.
