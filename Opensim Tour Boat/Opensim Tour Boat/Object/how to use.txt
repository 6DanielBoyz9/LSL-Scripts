INSTRUCTIONS
================================================== ===============
This script allows you to move a boat along a route
specified a series of coordinates stored in a notecard.

Abbreviations used:
-------------------------
"BE" => indicates the object boat_engine
 
Positioning & Link:
----------------------
Place the BE in your boat, the texture of the BE indicate the
direction of the bow. We advise you to place the bottom BE
vs. the boat, more or less in the center.
CAUTION: When the BE is linked to the craft do it last so it the main prim (link number = 1).

Entering parameters (notecard param.config):
----------------------------------------------
Lines starting with # are comments and are
ignored during loading. Empty lines are
excluded, however, to improve performance, 
after setup, it would be better to remove all
blank lines and comments. Keep in mind that for every read of each 
single line it takes about 0.1 seconds. Eliminate
comments and blank lines means improving the speed of
loading the parameters.

Optional parameters are present with the comment symbol
before the name. To set a value other than
default, remove the # sign at the left margin.

The parameters are all in the format: name = value
it does not matter iof there are spaces before or after the sign =
Each line can contain only one parameter.
Shift & / or lowercase letters in the name does not make a difference.

-----------
STARTPOS: initial position of the vessel, the same location where
the boat will be sent at the end of the tour.
Enter the coordinates of the position vector format <X, Y, Z>
The Z can be left at 0, the loading will be set to
sea ​​level.

example:
startpos = <92,162,20>
-----------
STARTROT: initial rotation of the vessel, the same rotation which
the boat will be set at the end of the tour.
The values ​​of the vector are the angles in degrees <X, Y, Z>.

example: startRot = <0,0,0>

-----------
HOVERWATER: BE height of the water level expressed in
meters. Warning: this is the height of the BE level
sea ​​and not the center line of the vessel.

example: hoverwater = 0.1
         
-----------
SPEED: speed (or pressure) of the boat.

example: speed = 2

-----------
PUSHTIME: how many seconds the boat gets a boost. Yup
recommended to stay between 0.2 and 0.6 seconds

example: pushtime = 0.3

-----------
DEBUG: enable / disable debug messages sent to
owner of BE. Equal to 1 if the messages are active,
set to 0 to disable the messages.

example: debug = 1

Note: once the positioning phase is recommended
= 0. The set of debug messages tend to slow down
the execution of events making the movement of the vessel
jerky.
 
-----------

Insertion path (notecard route.config):
----------------------------------------------
The notecard route.config contains the sequence of positions that
the vessel will have to go in his tour.
Each line must contain a position vector <X, Y, Z>.
The value of Z can be left at 0, will be set
automatically height of the sea.

WARNING !!!!: BE uses physical functions for the movement of
vessel, this will NOT work across different SIMs.
When setting your path be careful not to exceed
the boundaries of the SIM, otherwise your boat will lose
control and could move suddenly in undefined positions
(Even under water or in the sky).

example:
We want to do a tour departing from <100,100,0>

<100, 110, 0>
<110, 110, 0>
<110, 100, 0>
<100, 100, 0>

Various considerations:
1) BE uses physics so if along the way encounters
    obstacles, these can block or divert the tour.
    Ensure that no prim of the boat touches the "backdrop"
    on the way, could run aground.
2) in the linear sections of your route there is no need to insert
    intermediate coordinates. This lets you avoid unnecessary notecard lines.
3) given the speed of turn is recommended to insert positions
    facilitating softer turns.
    
OPERATION USER:
================================================== ===============
When a user touches the boat, after a few tenth of a second
Wait, this part of the tour begins in physical mode.
As the tour is ended (reached in the latest reported position
route.config) the vessel becomes NOT physical and resumes
the position and rotation set startpos and startRot.

OPERATION OWNER:
================================================== ===============
When the owner of the boat touches a menu appears with
the following functions:

START: if the boat is at rest, start moving.

STOP: if the boat is moving to the reset position
            startpos, startRot and removes the physical flag.

LOAD_PARAM: charging the parameters in param.config,
            use it in case of change of the notecard.

LOAD_ROUTE: charging the parameters in route.config,
            use it in case of change of the notecard.
