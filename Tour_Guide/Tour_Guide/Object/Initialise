// :DESCRIPTION:
// This Tour Guide by Wandering Yaffle for Second Life turns a set of coordinates and notecards into an automated tour. The object hovers along a path, emitting chat lines at each stop and waiting to be touched to continue.// // Place the following script and notecards in an object. Add a notecard for each stop in the tour. The "initialise" notecard contains the x,y,z coordinates and the names of notecards with chat lines. Waypoints with no comment are noted with ">". These are useful for going around walls, up stairways, etc. // // Sample "initialise" notecard
