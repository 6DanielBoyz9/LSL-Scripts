// All-In-One Animator with new commands 
// :CODE:
I have someting new that may help greatly with NPC's.  It's a new version of the All-In-One animator - it has the usualy commands to crate a NPC, control it ina routine, such as walking, sitting, or animating, 

It also accepts the new command, @appearance=Notecard which can switch the appearance at any time.

It also accepts external commands from simple sensors, collision, or touch events that will control the NPC.
