// All-In-One NPC Animator with new commands 
// :CODE:
This may help greatly with NPC's.  It's a new version of the All-In-One animator - it has the usualy commands to create a NPC, control it in
a routine, such as walking, sitting, or animating.  It also accepts the new command, @appearance=Notecard which can switch the appearance at 
any time.  It also accepts external commands from simple sensors, collision, or touch events that will control the NPC.
